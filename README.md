# Jira Ticket Links

Add links to Jira tickets in the terminal.

## Usage

* Add the base URL of your Jira instance in the settings, then just hover over any ticket code in your terminal!

## Extension Settings

* `jira_ticket_links.jira_url`: Jira base URL before the ticket ID, e.g. https://jira.example.biz/browse. The link will be this path with the ticket appended, e.g. https://jira.example.biz/browse/TICKET-1234.
